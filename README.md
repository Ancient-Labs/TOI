Tower Of Improvement [WIP]
---

This is the first OpenSource project of Antient Labs.

### Main Goal
This is an OpenSource app for self-development.

Based on the famous sentence "Rome wasn't built in a day". I took time to build thing, your future too !

No like a todo list, you have main goals to accomplish, this same goals are split into small accomplishments to build a tower. Once this tower is done, this mean you achieve your main/big goal.

### Example
Main goal : Build an house

your main goal will be split into different bricks :
  
  - Save money
  - Make plans
  - Find a plot
  - Buy the plot
  - Laying the foundations
  - Build the walls
  - Install windows and doors
  - Do the plumbing
  - Make Electricity
  - Paint the walls
  - Moved in

Once all this bricks are on your tower, this mean your goal to build an house if accomplished
